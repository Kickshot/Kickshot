Hello!

So, the files in this folder are to test and see if they would work, referencing the mesh file. Each animation contains the gun's mesh.

I was unable to figure out how to make the animation play without the gun mesh, but I left a testable file in the secondary folder. Those files simply does contain the gun's mesh, but still points to the base mesh.

Lastly, the hand's textures are all the PSD file Albedo. Should be the exact same files as the Ace body mesh, as I literally ripped those arms off.

Let me know!
